# now-catch-all-test

This iste using `[...slug].tsx` as the catch-all route.

In local development, visiting `/` should show **The slug is: home!**

Visit `https://catch-all-test-mrjohn.meerkats.now.sh/` (deployed to Now) shows **The slug is: !**

Visiting `/chicken/wings` on either shows **The slug is: chicken/wings!**
